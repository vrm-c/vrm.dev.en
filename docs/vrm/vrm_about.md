# What is VRM ? What can VRM do ?

## What is VRM?

- It can handle **humanoid character avatars**.

- It is a **cross-platform** [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) based format.
  - It can be used in game engines and on the web. ➡️ [plugins](/showcase/?flags=8)
  - **We provide Unity importer/exporter** ➡️ [UniVRM](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases)

## What can you do with VRM?

You can share the same avatar (3D model) data between VRM-compatible applications. <br/>
Once all the compatible applications are in place, the future could look something like this...

- First, you create your own avatar using a VRM-compatible character creation tool.
- When you were broadcasting live with your avatar, your friend also started broadcasting live, so you joined in your friend's broadcast.
- After the broadcast, you can launch the VR game and explore the VR world with your own avatar.
- You get bored with the game so you move to the chat in the VR world and play with your friends using the same avatar.
- The next day, you participate in a VR study session in VR. Of course, your avatar will be in its usual form.

**By using your own avatar (3D model data) in VRM format, you can access various applications and games that support VRM**.

Live streaming, video creation, games, chat.... The virtual worlds are not connected with each other. Using VRM is the first step to bridge those virtual worlds
